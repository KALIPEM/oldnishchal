We will start a NGO called, The Nishchal foundation, or something else, to support the research and tapsya that goes
into being Nishchal towards for our national politics. For his company, Preseed, is really an endeavour to serve the
citizens of India by already delivering through really useful tech features - his intent, boundless imagination (root of
our future political manifesto) and far fetched ingenious effort towards nation building through tech and education
innovation, like none other in vision. Hence, first Preseed, Politics, later. His being is very important to the truth
knowing educated India we dream. <br><br>

directly on the Patreon link mentioned above, and we will all be supported as a result. <br><br>

There are a very few straight spine affirmative in action kind of men like him left in the now, very corrupt India. The
single biggest reason for us to be a part of his vision is this.

                While in college, he has prioritised knowledge and curiosity to find truth, as his priority. So, he designed his career
                around the far fetched vision that stems out of his kind of knowledge and curiosities. However, it takes all his time,
                leaving hardly any, to chase money.

                We wish we never had to take your monetary support. We wish Nishchal could roll in
                advertising money. But then running a blog or channel of delivering controversial truth is
                the WORST idea for such a business model!

                <b style="text-align: center; font-size:0.9em; color: black">We are reminded of these words in these
                  times of his wound</b> - “Don’t be
                ashamed to need help. Like a soldier storming a wall, you have a mission to accomplish. And if
                you’ve been wounded and you need a comrade to pull you up? So what?” — Marcus Aurelius <br><br>

                “Asking for help takes strength, to be honest with oneself and others, to know when one is over
                their head. It takes a certain amount of humility to admit this, but it is also an act of strength.
                It took me time to accumulate this kind strength, but I always had that humility to admit I needed
                help — Aurelius, as strong as he was as Rome’s emperor, understood this very well, and so have I. So
                here I am, asking for help” - Nishchal.

                <br><br>
                His work is NOT FIT FOR ADVERTISERS. Advertisers, just like most Indian investors want to be
                politically correct. In fact they want to further add to cultural programming which makes an
                Indian citizen say, "I don't care who is ruling the country, but the Ram temple must be
                built".
                <br><br>
                (Note - He voted for BJP and made us do so too, twice. So, clearly he was not against the
                propoganda being done by using the name of Ram, even if he may on the outset appear to be
                against religions. Only a fool will be against the great lord Ram of India or the original
                Hindu religion, before it became spurious like all other religions. In fact, he is building
                a chatbot in the next 5 years for his app <a href="http://www.chattodo.co">www.chattodo.co</a> which
                will hopefully express the
                values of मर्यादा पुरुषोत्तम राम better than what a temple can do, in the age of global
                social networks. I am against wasting public money and time on matters that parties benefit
                from the most, not the public at large from North to South, from East to West).

                So, your money is going into solving the problem of media and social media-induced cultural
                programming through which one perceives. It’s a mass hallucination of the herd, by the herd,
                for the herd. I wish to help them snap-out of lies, to see their actual individual worth
                beyond group-isms.
                <br><br>
                I want to reach out to thousands of worthy men and women through my blog, Preseed Essays. It
                is mainly to continue my research, curation, and writing on Preseed Essays that we need your
                sponsorship. RESEARCH | VISION | CULTURE | SCIENCE | TRUTH through my counter-culture blog,
                Preseed Essays, written as chapters from 1 to 20.
                <br><br>
                To say the least, if you sponsor my life for the next 3 years, you will help me inspire
                students to break out of the meaningless century-old structures of herd factories also
                called ‘colleges’, help them see through my blog, Preseed Essays, the boundless
                possibilities that are ahead of them. Above all, it will teach them, not to judge anyone
                till they have enough evidence and facts. I feel this conduct is fundamental to fixing our
                society. My essays will enable the people of rage to know how much they don't know, before
                reacting or causing stress and conflict.

    <i>
      Through my Essays, I want to bring more clarity to the public conversation on what’s
      really
      happening in the world. Too much of the public discussion is focused either on the wrong
      issues
      stemming from the past or is extremely confused to ever get to discuss the future that
      science
      fiction has always revealed is coming. People are flooded by enormous amounts of
      repetitive
      information of past, which they don’t know how to make sense of, so they just do what
      the
      herd
      does, follow each other, blindly, and mostly in surrender to their egos. I see my
      mission as
      bringing clarity to the public discussion especially in terms of focusing people’s
      attention
      on
      the most important questions that will confront us in 5 years. Question and not answers,
      for
      I
      don’t have all the answers. The important thing is, to agree about the questions. For
      questions
      will set the tone of our discourse for the sake of a better future. I would end by
      saying
      that
      there are 10 big challenges to humankind in the 21st century- the nuclear war, climate
      change,
      technological disruption, pathetic criminal justice system, selfish capitalism or
      mindless
      consumerism, representative democracy, media accountability, no universal basic income,
      parenting, and education system. These should be the first 10 items on the political
      agenda
      of
      every country. If I have to mention one more it would be — finding happiness or at least
      tranquility amidst these disasters, through Yog. My essays are about these.
      <br><br>
      I have added my own essays from my Youtube channel too in these essays at the right
      places
      so as
      to put my things in perspective and I have requested you to even read the descriptions
      on
      youtube of each video from me as I describe matters beyond the respective video there.
      In
      totality, my effort on this essay are made up of about 60000+ words. So, if you go
      through
      them
      you will go through, say, 12+ Chapters worth of reading to understand, how serious we
      are
      about
      changing the world around you — through the culmination of it all into codes to make
      that
      change
      as is expressed in the essays. If you can finish a small book of 12 chapters in 1 week,
      amidst
      your busy schedule, you can finish this too in one week.</i>

              our failed attempt - He is the founder and a boundless leader at <a href="http://www.chattodo.co/"
                target="_blank">Chattodo</a> and <a href="https://math.preseed.in" target="_blank">Math Ed Labs.</a>
              He is not an engineer by a degree but leads engineers. He is not a designer by a degree, but our team
              recognizes him as the best non-cosmetic designer mind they have known. He understands engineering and
              designing as a first principle philosopher much like how he understands life from its origin.

                Namastey,
              </div>
              <div class="pem" align="left">We are a small culture in India called Preseed. We are
                running
                under
                an unusual man’s leadership.
                It’s his imagination, courage, knowledge and intellect, and the act of our people
                that
                make us
                extremely valuable support to a man or a woman with a will to do something out of
                the
                ordinary.
                We
                are
                a result of his words expressed on his blog, this website - <a href="https://preseed.in"
                  target="_blank">www.preseed.in</a> and all its
                associated links.</div>

              <div class="pem" align="left">We are with him in his culture due to the following
                attributes
                we have
                observed in him:</div>

              <div class="pem" align="left">1. His extraordinary mass consumer ideas.<br>
                2. His courageous way of being, leading and creating.<br>
                3. His ability to execute those ideas to become MVPs without a single penny. (This
                is
                the most
                important point: it would have reduced the cost of important experimentation in
                India by
                more
                than
                4x,
                just as it has done for our organisation because of his bility to replace money with
                inspiration
                among
                one and all in our team, leading to really low costs of creation so far).<br>
                4. His ability to communicate extremly complex ideas as smaller fragments
                effectively
                and
                inspiringly
                with our globally distributed remotes teams.<br>
                6. His courage to do before anyone else and his ability to face odds before anyone
                else
                will
                face
                them.<br>
                He leads before he eats and he has only gotten started. </div>

              <div class="pem" align="left">He teaches us to be patient, to persevere, to keep it
                going,
                to have
                fun, to exercise and to be in
                meditation.</div>


              <div class="pem" align="left">His haters call him an objective asshole. You may too, if
                you
                can’t
                back your gut or ego with
                intelligent reasoning and facts. Even your belief in god needs to be addressed with
                that
                level
                of
                reasoning, just in case you wanted to touch that topic with him. For you are allowed
                to
                touch
                absolutely any topic in the universe with him. When he dives deep with you in realms
                that look
                subjective to you, he will still be being objective. He will have deep rooted
                reasons,
                and you
                will
                have to stretch your imagination to see those reasons. It’s on you fellows, like it
                is
                on us,
                his
                team. Only if he sugarquoted and had filters, our lives would have been less
                intense,
                and he
                wouldn’t
                have been called an objective asshole. If you are looking for lesser intensity and
                sugarquoting.
                This
                is a wrong place. If you are looking to build some meaningful company or build
                Preseed
                further,
                this
                is THE PLACE.</div>

                result of which will be your great company. This blog must be read well and to great

              </div>



              <div class="pem" align="left">We often see him as a person who strikes a great balance
                between 1 &
                2:<br></br>
                1. That people don't always need advice, sometimes they just need a hand to hold, an
                ear
                to
                listen
                and
                a heart to understand.

                <br><br>


                2. After he has understood that just listening to you is not enough, you need
                advice,
                then his
                way
                of
                holding hand comes in. It comes from his vast sea of imagination and knowledge. He
                delivers it
                through, non-sugary words. That is his way of love. His way of love is in being,
                firstly
                a good
                listener and then a good advisor. His advise comes without filters. Be ware, for, if
                he
                corrects
                you
                and you feel offended, then you have an ego problem. And if you have that problem,
                you
                may not
                survive
                Nishchal for too long.

                <br><br>

                To us Nishchal is not an objective asshole. He is an all-seeing eye, on a mission.
                And
                in that
                journey, he cares about no one, not even himself, more than the mission itself. For
                it
                is in
                this
                mission he can actually take better care of one and all.

                <br><br>

                Even the strongest men in his situation would begin to conform to norms. Yet, he is
                not
                the man
                who
                will succumb to circumstances. Many times over the last 10 years he has hit rock
                bottom.
                Every
                penny
                he makes,he has invested in his software whims to do good in this society. He continued
                to
                compensate
                his
                teams, over and above his own survival, to at times sleep with no roof, cash, food
                and
                phone.
                Even
                his
                family lost all of it a long time ago when he was barely 20. He was pressed by his
                family and
                well
                wishers to take up a job, for he was receiving lucrative job offers by the day. He
                was
                criticized
                by
                those who ones loved him. A person in his situation should have not survived. In
                this
                period of
                struggle, no one came to his aid. He kept his head held high, didn’t take up a job
                and
                still
                sails
                forward like a warrior on his mission to free the world from present structures,
                boundaries and
                meanings. This journey is leading him into a true story of rarest courage and
                conviction, as it
                unfolds before the world, in more action than words, over a long period of time.

                <br><br>

                He lives in the world of extraordinary ideas, idealism, inspiration, simplicity, a
                bicycle, a
                backpack, some yoga and lots of action. He questions, inspires and teaches us to be
                who
                we are
                becoming on this journey together. He does this in his well informed, imaginative,
                idealistic,
                bold
                and democratic style of leadership, unique only to him.
                He is Preseed’s first resident Yoga exponent and researcher.
                <br><br>
                He is in his early 30s, and has a way to express his theory of no god or the origin
                of
                the
                universe,
                its end and what after the end, without using religion and mysticism. We have never
                known anyone
                who
                can express such complex ideas with such ease, passion and simplicity. When one asks
                him, how do
                you
                know all this and how do you dabble between spirituality and the material world of
                technology.
                He
                says, "Firsly, none of what I know is my own. It is all just flowing through me. The
                reason for
                that
                is resonation. I am at the same frequency as the fundamental truth itself". And then
                he
                goes on
                to
                explain how energy flows into each other and how shapes and forms take place. So,
                one of
                his
                favourite
                quotes is -

              </div>

              <br>
              <blockquote class="text_cursive quote_part">&quot;I think the trouble with being a
                critical
                thinker

                an atheist, or a humanist is that you’re right. And it’s quite hard being right in
                the
                face of
                people
                who are wrong without sounding like a fuckwit. People go ‘Do you think the vast
                majority
                of the
                world
                is wrong?’ Well, yes. I don’t know how to say that nicely, but yes." - TIM MINCHIN

                He is unabashed in praising you as he is unabashed in praising himself. He says,

              <div class="pem" align="left">
                His life's purpose may be summed up as following :-
                <br><br>
                <b>1. Karma</b> - His purpose is to work in the area of liberating people through
                technology
                entrepreneurship of the righteous intent, so that at least some of them could truly
                and
                soulfully
                do
                that what is meaningful to their soul.
                <br><br>
                <b>2. Dharma</b> - He walks the path of karma also to help (wo)mankind make progress
                through
                their
                own
                actions towards liberating them from their non scientific and rigid beliefs of life
                and
                universe,
                so
                that they could do what they find harmony in. Hence, his purpose is also to ensure
                that
                the soul
                is
                not ignored any more. His purpose is to understand and impart the awareness of the
                god's
                vibe
                through
                yoga.
                <br><br>
                <b>3. Seva</b> - His purpose is to ensure that each life he touches on this journey
                to
                building
                products gets truly served in their righteous progress. This is how he perceives the
                value of
                his
                products, not through the value of money.
                <br><br>
                The things he do in a day, enable him to stumble upon many teams with good ideas and
                a
                strong
                will
                to
                build further upon their ideas, through their skills, perhaps even a sound
                prototype,
                logistical
                and
                back end capabilities. Almost invariably, if he finds them good enough to ping his
                mind,
                he
                would
                have
                views for them that could help them make further progress. But these views are not
                mere
                theoretical
                views, these are strategies that need to be executed beyond the current capabilities
                of
                the
                prototype
                team. So, in order to help these teams at different stages of the startup life cycle
                we
                have
                allowed
                for such teams to engage with Nishchal directly. Although, this will be useful when
                startup
                teams
                are
                willing to stay focused on the strategy proposed by Nishchal, above all else.

              If you want Nishchal, remember these two quotes.

              <!---  When the result of the actions upon these ideas, stories and inspiration takes its first
      real form
      that can be demoed to such investors and customers, as per us; the startup is hand held

                    What keeps Nishchal humble is his childlike curiosity and his willingness to accept failures. What
                    makes him
                    confident
                    is his audacity to learn, adapt and evolve. <br>

                    Don't expect humility from him, if you deliver ignorance. Naturally, every stimuli must have its
                    right response.

                Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,<br>
                Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,<br>

              “Once, about 5 years ago I was asked where do I see myself 20 years from now. <br>
              I said, “pitching myself to the people of India, as a candidate for the job of <br>
              Prime Minister of India”. The traditional Indian investor said, “I was too <br>
              delusional even for the most ambitious 30 year old”. I said, “That depends on<br>
              how you look at it. I have learned over the years that an ambition that is large, is<br>
              often perceived as delusional, if you are a friend. And if you are a client, then <br>
              illusional or too good to be true”. They both had a good laugh. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              “I am mostly content pursuing my lofty goals as an entrepreneur. The only<br>
              reason I would like to be a prime minister one day is because I don’t want to let <br>
              anyone have the power to put anyone in jail without clear evidence against that <br>
              person for that crime. The recent threat of not fascisim as much as, the<br>
              normalisation of gross misuse of law, in India, is the greatest human rights <br>
              threat to the loud courageous voices among 130 crore people<br>
              among us. I want
              to be the prime minister who puts justice as his first in the list of priorities. <br> Then
              development. And then
              religion, if religion manages to endure<br>
              till 2050.
              Thereafter, the country can finally be free to say what it wills,<br>
              without the fear
              of being prosecuted for saying something they believe to be<br>
              true”. I know that
              is my last goal of working life and I am not scared to <br>
              mention it. I want to leave
              my work when I am satisfied with the level of <br>
              freedom a human feels in his day
              to day. And in that I observe, that men <br>
              languishing in prisons for no established
              crime, let alone, that it was done <br>
              by the accused, deserve 'freedom', the most.
              This change will be the start to the <br>
              genuine overhauling of the entire criminal justice
              system over the next 30 years<br>
              across the world. A prime minister of India has the power to do
              that.
              <br>
              <br>

              If he doesn’t, I will.
              <br>
              So I can do so. I am starting The Nishchal foundation. Here I will put together my<br>
              research and development essays.
              When an innocent is sent to jail for a heinous crime he never committed, it is a threat to over
              a 90% of the democratic world. Because there are two kinds of people, innocents, and criminals.
              Most are not dangerous criminals.
              <br>
              I need you to

              Imagine an energetic child in school, class 1. He has 12 years to learn, to <br>
              get to the next phase. I am right there in my goal to become a prime minister. I have <br>
              much to learn over the next 20 years. All I have acquired well is the intent and space where
              knowledge <br>
              happens. Now I will leave it for your criticisms and opinions to drive me forward <br>
              in my further enquiries in life. I thrive on it. Your opinions on politics and religion<br>
              is going to help me get more knowledge across the next 20 years of my life <br>
              about the fundamentals that will help humanity thrive by the time your children<br>
              become your current age . The best part is, I am, through this large goal,<br>
              opening myself to a new realm and I am glad I did so. I couldn’t have asked for <br>
              more purpose in life. <br>
              <br>
              <img src="img/sofar.jpeg" class="img img-responsive" alt=""> <br><br>
              So far I have successfully imagined I believe the influence of social networks in <br>
              India when designed for talks, as against the influence of social networks in the <br>
              world when designed for evidence based productivity. <br>
              <br>
              Implying, no one will be spoken hatefully publically about anyone without any <br>
              evidence against that person or belief. Twitter and Facebook are the places for<br>
              you if you choose to do that. <br>
              <br>
              In 2020 we are in a mess of mythological stories presented as gods or religions<br>
              with no proof of either or. Just beliefs. Very special and dedicated attention <br>
              needs to be put to understanding life fundamentals before understanding <br>
              the dance upon it. <br>
              <br>
              A great example is among the popular religions called Hinduism as the most<br>
              holy. Need I say more about what many Hindus must have done to have made <br>
              India so poor and unemployed, in spite of temples at every corner. Thank god <br>
              other religions like Islam and christianity have started to begin being called out<br>
              for their nonsense so by and large that I don't need to intervene. May that time <br>
              come for Hindus too. I think its coming. <br>
              <br>
              The only religion practically possible to be practiced by a humble human being<br>
              is a religion of - curiosity about fundamentals behind movement of mi
              nd and stillness of mind. Vedic age was about that first, not temples and mass rituals. Just
              stillness
              and <br>
              movement of smallest common particles the<br>
              whole universe is geometrically aligned with. And thewhy? To know this <br>
              why, that stillness called Samadhi is very important.<br>
              <br>
              Such is the kind of social community I wish to build. A community of <br>
              curiosity, not religions".<br>

              <br><br>

              Along the way you will figure out the abstracts of how we are extrapolating our mission by
              laying the foundation for the new education and criminal justice system. This is my end game.
              Preseed is the incubator to incubate that plan of mine, just as it would do for you too, if you
              have also got something conscientious and inspiring.
              <br>

                I am doing things for you, for a better tomorrow for both you and I. If need be, I will be
                willing to subject myself to an election campaign too, to someday after a few years from
                today, to be your prime ministerial candidate. Consider my writings an evolving political
                manifesto in that case, which will be frozen only 1 year before my entry into politics. I
                want to give few more years to learn more lessons as I write in real-time. Must you not dig
                me really deep? Be informed about who I am.

              you’ve been wounded and you need a comrade to pull you up? So what?” — Marcus Aurelius <br><br>
            
              “Asking for help takes strength, to be honest with oneself and others, to know when one is over
              their head. It takes a certain amount of humility to admit this, but it is also an act of strength.
              It took me time to accumulate this kind strength, but I always had that humility to admit I needed
              help — Aurelius, as strong as he was as Rome’s emperor, understood this very well, and so have I. So
              here I am, asking for help” - Nishchal.

              His work is NOT FIT FOR ADVERTISERS. Advertisers, just like most Indian investors want to be
              politically correct. In fact they want to further add to cultural programming which makes an
              Indian citizen say, "I don't care who is ruling the country, but the Ram temple must be

              Hindu religion, before it became spurious like all other religions. In fact, he is building
              a chatbot in the next 5 years for his app <a href="http://www.chattodo.co">www.chattodo.co</a> which
              will hopefully express the
              values of मर्यादा पुरुषोत्तम राम better than what a temple can do, in the age of global
              social networks. I am against wasting public money and time on matters that parties benefit
              from the most, not the public at large from North to South, from East to West).

			(Nishchal's views on Modi Ji and Yogi Ji have changed from the days since this draft was written).
			<br><br>
			(मोदी जी और योगी जी पर निश्चल के विचार इस मसौदे के लिखे जाने के दिनों से बदल गए हैं)
			<br><br>
                  मेरे देश की कूप मंडूक प्रजा मैं यह कहना चाहता हूं कि हमारे देश के ज्यादातर नेताओं ने
                  आपके भोलेपन को भेड़ चाल में बदल दिया और देश में अपनी आडंबरई एजेंडा को ठोक दिया| MODI JI
                  has done the same.
                  योगी जी उत्तर प्रदेश में गुंडाराज खत्म करने आए थे उन्होंने गुंडों के सर से टोपी हटाकर
                  पुलिस को पहना दी । जो गुंडाराज अगले 1 साल में खत्म होना था वह 4 साल में भी नहीं खत्म हुआ
                  वैराम योगी जी ने उत्तर प्रदेश में धर्म तथा बटवारा और मंदिर की फर्जी राजनीति की है। अगर
                  योगी जी ने एक भी और एजेंडा पर काम किया होता मंदिर के अलावा तो कुछ और भी बदल सकता था अगर
                  मंदिर का एजेंडा बदला है तो। फिलहाल आप मंदिर बना रहे हैं और उस मंदिर की आड़ में तानाशाही
                  शुरू हो रही है आज मैं यह सोच रहा हूं कि मैंने इस तानाशाही नेता को कैसे अपना वोट दे दिया
                  |
                  एक वह समय था जब मैं योगी जी के खिलाफ कुछ सुनना नहीं चाहता था। बल्कि उनके खिलाफ कोई कुछ
                  बोलता था तो मैं उन लोगों से बहस करने लगता था।और आज वह समय है कि मैं देश में गुरुदेव
                  नरेंद्र मोदी जी को देखना चाहता हूं परंतु राज्य में योगी जी को नहीं | योगी आदित्यनाथ ही
                  वह कारण है कि प्प्रदेश की प्रगति नहीं हो रही | मोदी जी की बेहतर नीतियों के बावजूद। अगर
                  योगी जी फिर से प्रदेश या पार्लियामेंट में आते हैं तो भाजपा 1 दिन इस देश से समाप्त हो
                  जाएगी अगले 10 साल में जैसे कांग्रेस समाप्त हुई राहुल गांधी की वजह से| योगी बीजेपी के
                  राहुल गांधी हैं|
                  में भाजपा की समाप्ति नहीं देख सकता। इस देश की भलाई भाजपा की केंद्र में दिल्ली में आप
                  पार्टी और यूपी में ?। <br>
                  <br>
                  अब मैं आपको रूबरू कराऊंगा कि कैसे पुलिस अपने आप को योगी का गुंडा समझते हैं। जिसको मन
                  चाहती है उसको जेल भेज देती है बिना इन्वेस्टिगेशन के शायद उन्हें यह करने का प्रोत्साहन
                  योगी जी की नीतियों से मिला शायद योगी जी को यह लगता है कि वह जेल भर के देश को यह दिखाना
                  चाहते कि उन्होंने प्रदेश के गुंडों को अंदर कर दिया। परंतु सत्य तो यह है जिस प्रदेश में
                  जेल भर भरी होगी सड़क पर आम नागरिक को दुख और बेरोजगारी होगी वह प्रदेश कभी सुखी नहीं
                  रहेगा।
                  <br>
                  योगी जी के शासन में आप सब यह देख ले कि एक शांतिपूर्वक आंदोलन करने की इजाजत भी नहीं है।
                  और अगर करेंगे पुलिस बिना किसी जुर्म के सबूत के जेल में डाल देगी।
                  योगी जी नीति यह भी थी कि महिलाओं के वोट बैंक बना ले और यह करने का सबसे आसान तरीका यह था
                  कि कोई भी महिला पुलिस के पास आए और कंप्लेंट करे तो बिना किसी सबूत के She can say, that,
                  someone is molesting/प्रताड़ित her।
                  इससे पुलिस का फायदा है। इसलिए पुलिस को यह नीति पसंद है। इस नीति के कारण पुलिस
                  कर्मचारियों को पैसा कमाने का भी मौका मिलता है।
                  क्योंकि जब बिना किसी सबूत के निर्दोष को गिरफ्तार करते हैं तो निर्दोष भयभीत होकर पुलिस की
                  मांगे पूरी करता है और ऐसे शुरू होती है पुलिस के corruption का सिलसिला। इसे महिलाओं का भी
                  फायदा है क्योंकि महिलाओं के किसी से कोई भी दुश्मनी हो वह बिना किसी सबूत के उस व्यक्ति पर
                  ३७६ का मुकदमा चला सकती है। पुलिस और महिला मिलकर उस व्यक्ति से उस उसके परिवार से पैसा लूट
                  सकते हैं।
                  कुछ ऐसे भी मुक़दमे होते हैं जिसमें कुछ गलत होता है जिसमें पुलिस पुरे परिवार को अंदर कर
                  लेती है। ऐसे मुकदमे डीपी आंख के तहत पाए जाते हैं। ऐसे डीपी एक्ट के तहत उपाय एक पति पत्नी
                  व यदि इसमें से अगर आपके साथ कुछ भी ना हुआ हो तो हो सकता है जिस प्रकार एक महिला और उसके
                  परिवार को यह शक्ति मिली है कि वह बिना सबूत के एक स्टेटमेंट पर किसी आदमी को अंदर कर सकते
                  हैं उसी प्रकार हर उस महिला और आदमीपरिवार से शक्ति चीनी है जिसके घर में एक बेटा कामा भाई
                  काम आप पति और बाप हैं। यह आंदोलन महिला और पुरुष का नहीं, परिवार की एकता के लिए और झूठे
                  मुकदमे के खिलाफ है।
                  <br><br> * I feel deeply about the empowerment of mothers. They are mostly home makers
                  dependent on the income brought by the husbands. I want to change that. I envisioned SFI
                  as that product during my stay back at home with my parents. this vision with a
                  potential great food tech startup like Hola Chef, for I believe, if. vision of SFI can
                  scale Hola Chef globally. It was during my research in matters of feminism that I came
                  to two conclusions: 1. Mothers needs to be empowered financially. 2. Women-centric
                  gender biased laws, be allowed to remain women centric gender biased. 3. The onus of
                  false complaints and jail time over such frivious complaints needs to come on the state.
                  A suitable compensation must be made. That is all I ask. There is no other solution, my
                  dear, MRAs

                    this because, Nishchal is solving a personal problem, but sincerely enough,
                    that
                    the solution may impact the whole world someday. The reward for genuine

                <!---<i>
                    Through my videos, I want to bring more clarity to the public conversation on what’s
                    really
                    happening in the world. Too much of the public discussion is focused either on the wrong
                    issues
                    stemming from the past or is extremely confused to ever get to discuss the future that
                    science
                    fiction has always revealed is coming. People are flooded by enormous amounts of
                    repetitive
                    information of past, which they don’t know how to make sense of, so they just do what
                    the
                    herd
                    does, follow each other, blindly, and mostly in surrender to their egos. I see my
                    mission as
                    bringing clarity to the public discussion especially in terms of focusing people’s
                    attention
                    on
                    the most important questions that will confront us in 5 years. Question and not answers,
                    for
                    I
                    don’t have all the answers. The important thing is, to agree about the questions. For
                    questions
                    will set the tone of our discourse for the sake of a better future. I would end by
                    saying
                    that
                    there are 10 big challenges to humankind in the 21st century- the nuclear war, climate
                    change,
                    technological disruption, pathetic criminal justice system, selfish capitalism or
                    mindless
                    consumerism, representative democracy, media accountability, no universal basic income,
                    parenting, and education system. These should be the first 10 items on the political
                    agenda
                    of
                    every country. If I have to mention one more it would be — finding happiness or at least
                    tranquility amidst these disasters, through Yog. My videos are about these.
                    <br><br>
                    I have added my own videos from my Youtube channel too in these videos at the right
                    places
                    so as
                    to put my things in perspective and I have requested you to even read the descriptions
                    on
                    youtube of each video from me as I describe matters beyond the respective video there.
                    In
                    totality, my effort on this essay are made up of about 60000+ words. So, if you go
                    through
                    them
                    you will go through, say, 12+ Chapters worth of reading to understand, how serious we
                    are
                    about
                    changing the world around you — through the culmination of it all into codes to make
                    that
                    change
                    as is expressed in the videos. If you can finish a small book of 12 chapters in 1 week,
                    amidst
                    your busy schedule, you can finish this too in one week.</i>-->

          <p class="desc" style="color: white;">This video is a monologue by Nishchal to his sister, Neha,
            around 2015 on a
            difficult day, to rid him of family's expectations so he can get the wings to do the boundless
            he is talking about through his words and links planted on this webpage. This video is a
            testimony to the fact that it does take a certain intensity to turn on, tune in, and drop out;
            of family and peer based normal structures/boundaries. We all can do it, so long as we are
            truthful, and for that reason transparent and unabashed. This video is for the Indian ambitious
            middle class imperfect mid 20 youth, like Nishchal was. At times, rash, in a hurry, but with a
            right heart. It's the rhythm of that heart which, he says, has helped him fix his shortcomings.

            मेरे अगले भाषण में मैं आपको रूबरू कराऊंगा भगवान और आत्मा से बिना भगवान का नाम लिया और बिना आत्मा का नाम
            के
            बिना देवी देवता के लिए बिना अल्लाह का नाम लिए बिना शिव, बुध नानक जीसस का नाम लिए बिना किसी मंत्र बिना
            किसी
            श्लोक बिना किसी ग्रंथ और बिना किसी पूजा और प्रेयर्स के अपने भगवान की खोज में। मैं अपनी खोज में कभी यह
            नहीं
            बोला कि आप लोग जो कर रहे हैं भगवान के नाम पर भी गलत है। क्योंकि मैंने किया नहीं और उसके बारे में मैं
            जानता
            भी नहीं मैंने भगवान और आत्मा के मुद्दे को बिना किसी दिए और घंटी के जाना है। और आज अपने अगले भाषण में
            बताऊंगा
            कि आप कौन हैं और आप भगवान से कैसे हैं। और मेरी बात से आपको सुकून मिले तो बुरा मत मानिए गा कि मैं आपके
            भगवान
            की खोज के तरीके का कभी-कभी आडंबर बोल दो। बल्कि सत्य यह है कि आप खोज ही नहीं रहे हैं आप मान रहे हैं। और
            यदि
            खोज खोजने की दिलचस्पी रखते हैं तो मेरे साथ आज एक नए धर्म से जुड़ी है। ये धर्म है खोजने का मानने का नहीं।
            इस
            इधर मैं आप सभी सूर्य को जल नहीं चढ़ाएंगे जब तक आप सूर्य को जल चढ़ाने का अर्थ ना समझ ले। इधर में आप सर
            नहीं
            चुकाएंगे जब तक आप नमाज का अर्थ न समझ ले। इस धर्म में आप कभी चर्च से दया की भीख नहीं मांगेंगे जब तक आप
            मांगने
            का अर्थ एडवोकेट चलन के बदलाव में ना समझ जाए। इस धर्म में मां-बाप को भगवान का दर्जा नहीं दिया जाएगा। इस
            धर्म
            में मां-बाप को गुरु का दर्जा दिया जा सकता है यदि वह दान में ज्ञान दें। यदि विधान में भोजन देते हैं तो
            उन्हें
            अन्नदाता का दर्जा दिया जा सकता है। और उनकी उसी प्रकार पूजा जाएगा जिस प्रकार एक अन्नदाता को पूजा जाता है।
            इस
            धर्म मैदान में ज्ञान और भोजन के अलावा कुछ नहीं दिया जाएगा। इस धर्म में गलत को यह बताने क्यों गलत है
            पुण्य का
            काम होगा। भले ही वह अपने गलत मां-बाप को यह बता बताया जाए कि वह गलत है इस धर्म में हर व्यक्ति को बहस करने
            की
            इजाजत है फुल सब बहस में उत्तेजित होने की भी इजाजत है। परंतु कभी अहिंसा करने की इजाजत नहीं है। इस धर्म
            में
            अगर घर में पूजा पाठ की बजाए अगर ज्ञान की बहस होगी तो वह एक धार्मिक घर माना जाएगा। <br><br>
            इस घर में हर वह चीज करने की इजाजत है जिसमें जो कर रहा है उसे भी खुशी मिले और जिसके साथ कर रहा है उसे भी
            खुशी
            मिले। इस धर्म में सहमति से संभोग करने की सभी को पूरी इजाजत है। इस धर्म में झूठ बोलने की इजाजत nahin है
            even
            if उस झूठ से किसी का दिल ना दुखे, बल्कि किसी का दिल दुखाने से बचे। परंतु यह ध्यान रहे कि आपके अंदर जो
            आत्मा
            है जो सबसे पहले गलत करने का एहसास हो जाता है और उस गलत करने की आत्मग्लानि आपको धीरे-धीरे नष्ट करेगी।
            इसलिए
            इस धर्म में हिंसा को गलत माना है। संभोग का नहीं। इस धर्म में असंभव को सबसे उच्च श्रेणी का गलत अधर्म आना
            है।
            इस धर्म में सब को अपने उन विचारों की आजादी है जिससे उनका मन संतुलन पाता है। पर अगर वह विचार किसी और से
            भेदभाव करने में सहयोग देते हैं तो यह संतुलन के भेद में तो यह असंतुलन है। इस धर्म में एक बच्चे को शिक्षा
            से
            पहले वेतन कमाने की आजादी नहीं है इस धर्म में अज्ञानता के अंधकार में डूबे पति पत्नी को यह या गर्लफ्रेंड
            बॉयफ्रेंड को बच्चे पैदा करने का अधिकार नहीं है। और यदि बच्चा पैदा होता है तो वह उस बच्चे की स्टेट
            संभालेगा।
            जब तक उसकी शिक्षा पूरी नहीं होती इस धर्म में भगवान निराकार है उसी प्रकार जिस प्रकार हर धर्म में भगवान
            निराकार है। परंतु इस धर्म में भगवान के निराकार ता का वर्णन हर धर्म से विभिन्न होगा या यूं कहिए कि इस
            धर्म
            में भगवान की निराकार ता का वर्णन होगा। और हर धर्म से साधारण होगा। इस धर्म में आंख बंद कर कर के सकारात्मक
            ख्याल को पूजा माना है। इस धर्म में लिखने की कला को नंबर दो का दर्जा दिया गया हैअब बोलने की कला को नंबर
            एक का
            दर्जा दिया गया है और समाज में प्रवेश करने को सुनने का दर्जा दिया गया है। क्योंकि धर्म एक खोज का धर्म है
            क्योंकि इसमें आडू का विज्ञान का सबसे उच्च श्रेणी काज्ञान का दर्जा दिया गया है। और इस विज्ञान पर ध्यान को
            अध्यात्म का मूल माना गया है और इस सारे शब्दों के ऊपर प्रेमभाव को माना गया है वह प्रेम भाव जिसमें आप बिना
            अपेक्षा के प्रेम करते हैं। इसमें पेट भर के भोजन करने को पाप माना गया है इसमें संगीत पर नाना छुपाने को भी
            पाप
            माना गया है। इसमें खेलकूद को शिक्षा के बराबर का दर्जा दिया गया है। इसमें आइडियल पने को नंबर एक का पाप
            माना
            गया है। और लत को नंबर 2 का पाप माना गया है। इसमें क्रोध को पाप माना गया है परंतु क्रोध को पालने को पाप
            नहीं
            माना गया है इसमें लोभ और मोह को तब तक पाप नहीं माना गया है जब तक आप चैन की नींद सो पाते हैं। इसमें आप के
            नीचे दर्जे का इंसान का मजाक उड़ाना भी पाप माना गया है। इसमें अपनी खुद की तारीफ करने को अहंकार नहीं माना
            गया
            है बल्कि इसमें यह कहा गया है कि जिस प्रकार आप किसी और की
            तारीफ कर सकते हैं उसी प्रकार आप अपने आप की भी तारीफ कर सकते हैं यदि आप ऐसा नहीं करते तो अब अपने को और
            दूसरे
            को अलग मानते हैं। इसमें आलस्य को पाप माना गया है। इसमें हर उस एंटरटेनमेंट किल्लत इसमें एक अच्छी ऊर्जा मन
            से
            उत्पन्न ना हो उसको पाप माना गया है। डर को पाप माना गया है भ्रष्टाचारियों को पाप माना गया है और किस किसी
            धर्म
            को गलत बोलने को सजा योग्य पाप माना गया है।
            इस धर्म में गॉसिप को आधार माना गया है। सूर्य की किरणों को ना पाना भी अधर माना गया है। स्कॉट्स ना लगाना
            भी।
            हर हफ्ते आजीवन एक पेड़ लगाने को धर्म माना गया है और उस पेड़ जिसमें फल होते हैं उसको गाने को ऊपर का दर्जा
            दिया गया है। भ्रष्टाचार पाप है। <br><br>
            आदर उम्र के हिसाब से नहीं बल्कि आचरण के हिसाब से सोच के हिसाब से।
            In short: मेरा अगला भाषण होगा भगवान पर और मंदिरों के आडंबर पर और कैसे यह दोनों ही हमारे देश के नागरिकों
            का
            समय व्यर्थ कर रहे हैं। और इस आडंबर का पर्दाफाश करने से पहले मेरा हर पंडित को यह मैसेज (छोटी और कलेवा
            कांटा) <br><br>

           <b>Q) Is your company Preseed Ventures Pvt. Ltd or an incubator or an investor of some kind?<br>
A)</b> Preseed is a virtual incubator primarily focused on incubating my own products first, which in turn are directly aligned with our mission of Freedom. Preseed takes inspiration in the way I think business ideas and hence, it stays focused on finding resources to empower him on his products first. The vision for the fund above is also really to find an investor who can create this fund which in turn enables us to continue finding more entrepreneurs like me who really want to do something genuinely meaningful. So, if the only way you can understand Preseed is by comparing it to an incubator, then consider thinking Preseed as an incubator that virtually incubates my startups first.
<br><br>
If Preseed likes you and your idea, it may consider supporting you with all it has got. If Preseed says yes to you, you will be aided beyond you can imagine.
<br><br>
<b>Q) What is virtual incubation?<br>
A)</b> An incubator that supports you like any other incubator but without a fixed physical space, or monetary investment.
For us to support people who are self-inspired, just an internet connection at their homes is sufficient.
<br><br>
 <b>Q) So if Preseed is not a typical incubator or a typical investor then what is Preseed ?</b><br>
This was an answer given by one of my advisors to someone who was not able to understand why we don’t care if the other startups understand us enough to come to us to use our services:
<br><br>
“Actually we are just a culture of sorts. A culture running under an unusual man’s leadership. It’s his imagination, courage, knowledge and intellect, and the act of our people that make us extremely valuable support to a man or a woman with a will to do something out of the ordinary.
<br><br>
The bottom line of trying to build some really cool companies out of our own ideas can be met in India, if we can successfully create a culture that makes their startup progression happen by way of our culture itself. For if they don’t succeed, they would have learnt the nuances to help us succeed in our products. So we are really a <b>culture</b> of liberated minds trying to do our thing in harmony with another. Let’s just say we as an organization are designed such that we find harmony in each other by way of who we are anyway”.
<br><br>
We are the guys who give you the fundamental idea, the product vision and its path.
<br><br> 
<b>Q) What does bring to the table in partnerships in which the product and the product vision is thoroughly already worked on?<br>
A)</b> Preseed brings the extraordinary minds and hence, the extraordinary creativity and hustle to the table on anything it touches upon. Read our website <a href="https://preseed.in" target="_blank">www.preseed.in</a> well.
<br><br>
<b>Q) Are you looking only for people to work on your specific ideas, Nishchal? How do you pick one over the others?</b><br>
I look for people mostly to work on my own consumer web ideas with, that is right. That is why I built Preseed in the first place. However, if there is ‘someone with an idea’ and or capability, that catches my fancy, I would be willing to put in all I can, into that idea too.
<br><br>
My experiences put me in a fairly good position to make judgments about what/who to pursue and what/who to say no to.
<br><br>
<b>Everything you do seems risky to me. What was the riskiest thing you have done so far, till turning 35 years of age?</b><br>
“Nothing is risky. It is all well thought of. Well, mostly.
<br><br>
Anyway, if we still have to point out something risky to the perspective of a mortal mind, that would be — at Preseed we have made some bad choices over the last few years, we have made a mistake of letting 3 really wrong people, at different times, to work with us. Mind you, we take righteousness very seriously. After they were laid off for their incapability/uselessness, deceitful vibes, and acts, they got together to start posting ill about us filled with baseless lies, frustration and hatred on public forums. One of them still keeps writing messages against us to our team members with an intent to bother them and to break relationships. Not only that, she went down to hatch a criminal conspiracy against Nishchal. What Nishchal did there after, is what makes him a hero, the world will sing songs about one day
<br><br>
We think these 3 men unfortunately got intimidated by our energy, outspokenness and levels of faith. Anyway, to each their own. Little do they know that greed, hate and lies fetch no one any good.
<br><br>
It was a seeming risk to have let them be a part of us for about 3–6 months to have them attempt damaging our culture of faith and love, with their deceit and hate. Their vibes from day one of their joining seemed tricky and greedy, we clearly took a risk by ignoring those vibes. We now know that even a day of having a hater (a person with a will to hate) in your company is a seeming risk of nurturing negative vibes under your wings for that day. And, we made a mistake of having 3 such men be under our wings for over 3 months. However, they had been fired out of our company long ago. We have forgiven the haters. May they find peace.
<br><br>
Although, such a risk of attracting sometimes the wrong men in a growing company cannot be fully avoided, but one can always be doubly alert and mindful.
<br><br>
Remember: <b>The vibe matters more than the skills. Trust your intuition about people”</b>
<br>
<b>Your thinking and words across your websites and videos seem like you will be better understood in Silicon Valley of America. Why are you still here? (Nishchal was asked this question in 2013)</b><br><br>
I like to be in the Himalayan region of India. It has some very knowledgable saints who are helping me progress further in my quest for exploring consciousness, that is, our identity outside of our body. Which I extrapolate often in terms of atoms and vibrations and silence and aum , and concentration of the mind deeply on a thought. USA was not the place for this topic. However it is a place for my other topic of technology ( which is linked with the laws of the creation of the universe from the point of god ) , but there it’s on the surface, yet quite advance, but the method I want to apply for the next 10 years, even in the way I manage Preseed, is more in tune with what can be found on the mountains of Himalayas.
<br><br>
In short, I am going with the flow, while being conscious of life and universe and me. 
but there the understanding of technological creation is outside the laws that govern the universe. Now of. course the place doesn’t matter. I carry my place or the mountains inside of me now.
<br><br>
<b>Q) I have an idea. How do I start engaging with you guys?<br><br>
A)</b> I recommend you to read <a href="https://medium.com/the-preseed/3c7dff3e0c64" target="_blank">this</a> and it’s surrounding links well. It will do a world of good to you. Contact us through our webpage.

            On our mission towards empowering those who have the will to do something out of the ordinary, we have
            covered some
            ground. By the way this is just a start. It is not going to be perfect, yet. However, we have decided to
            dedicate our
            whole lives to the cause of meaningful technology entrepreneurship, regardless. We hope we are able to be of
            some impact
            there. Infact we have set up a self sustainable innivation playground of sorts at <a
              href="https://preseed.in/">www.preseed.in</a> where some of you
            inspired ones can build with us web products, upon ideas that aid me in the above mentioned goals.. Some of
            those goals
            may truly have the potential to change the world. This is the pitch that formed the goal of conducting these
            talks. As a
            result, Chattodo got built.

      <div class="faq__content" id="summary-content">
    
      <p>
        I had built a web app called <a href="https://todoed.co">todoed.co</a> with an
        able team. I believe it could be a game-changer sort of a product in two markets
        'productivity' and 'social networking'. Many suggest its novel enough to be of
        some interest for acquisition by other productivity tool majors as soon as we
        have it be scalable and with 10x more users. It seemed very doable going by the
        seeming strength and spirit of the past Todoed team. However, I believe Todoed
        will be a major in itself. It will be the door to productivity for the new age
        of work which is done on browsers, mobile and chats. It's not here to get
        acquired. It's here to build something grand. We were at over 1500+ downloads.
        CNET, and PC World wrote fair articles about us. In short: It's a text clipper
        that turns any text on browser into a task. It's just a chrome extension for
        now. Soon, it will be on all devices and other significant platforms. But most
        importantly, Todoed is no more Todoed, it is Chattodo. It is becoming a
        full-fledged social network of action in its new avatar. We need $100,000 to get
        to the next phase of the development of this app to get to a stable MVP. And we
        will further need $100,000 for initial distribution and growth of it. That
        should be enough for us to be in the hands of 100,000+ active and meaningful
        users. That however, will just be the start. This money will keep us well
        sustained for well over 1 year as we craft the path for growth. That is what we
        are looking at to say the least. If we are sustained without distractions of
        sitting for another round of investment for 1 more year. We would be set right
        to be creative and explosive; more than Slack. b) My work in non physical form
        (is also work) - Phone - Written to you about earlier. Everything else - What I
        do as tangible physical work, I will find others to help me build. It's pretty
        straight forward and to an investor's mind, the exit may seem clearer when they
        are spoken to about a product like Todoed and not a business of a founder's
        lifestyle, however progressive. So what I do as work in non physical form is my
        lifestyle, I feel only my family, my fellow beings, could help, for here, I
        can't think in terms of projections or presentations, or rather I don't have
        time to.
      
        I can only think in terms of equity stocks in how many important products of the
        future can we have as mere advisors sometimes, to say the least. No monetary
        investment, and yet, equity stocks in some important companies of the future.
        So, the below mentioned is about how I spend the other non working half of my
        day, i.e. the time I am not dreaming and building a product that can make the
        world more productive - Todoed. Proceed reading if you allow me half an hour of
        your time to hear my whim, long term obsessive whim, in mere words, and no
        numbers.
      
        The website of Preseed is my narrative on my work in physcial form, and non
        physical form both, in brief, that together form my complete whim in a day. -: I
        am building a very important company around my lifestyle, a lifestyle of a
        pre-seed. The state before there is a seed. The most boundless state of them
        all. I live in that state. How can then the foundation of my company be any
        different. Such is the foundation we are building our company upon, I affirm,
        however, the result will depend on, my leadership here on.

      The ultimate marketing plan of Preseed -
      <br><br>
      I want to give the world answers to generic questions people ask. But, in my own
      way. I need some one to focus on writing my book out of the words on my website
      on and marketing it exceptionally across India. I have the conviction in my
      words to be able inspire every person I speak to, to move towards the same goal
      as me. THE CALL TO ACTION of this book is TO BRING IN THE RIGHT GUYS through our
      application forms.
      <br><br>He is on a quest to know the precise truth of our origin or god. He
      places his
      research here. He is not afraid to call a spade a spade, and a flake a flake.
      When he learns the truth, he is not afraid to call you out on your shit in such
      times of victimhood and judgment, where a man with no voice is appreciated among
      citizens, friends, and family more than a man with the voice of critical
      intelligence. Till Chattodo is built to his satisfaction, <mark><a href="https://medium.com/the-preseed">Preseed
          Essays</a> are his gifts
        to the children of the same friends & family</mark>. Make sure your children
      dig through each word on Preseed websites & essays if you care about inducing in
      them, #courage & #compassion through #science & #truth as much as you have cared
      about education through degrees and your parents have cared about politics
      through dogmas until now. Temples, mosques, churches, and religions generally,
      at least the way they are projected now, are not the solutions, or say, were
      solutions once perhaps, that are now completely destroyed by the current
      political narrative in most parts of the world. The net result of his essays and
      products we hope leads to, some contribution towards the inevitable death of
      most ists/isms, ideologies and religions of the past - <mark>making way for just
        simple #meditation, with new seeming contradictions; wishfully the only
        remaining isms - science/tech-ism & #minimalism</mark>, simultaneously. All
      this because Nishchal is solving a personal problem, but sincerely enough, that
      the solution may impact the whole world someday. The reward for genuine
      sincerity, often, is such. <a href="https://www.gencosys.org/" target="_blank">Donate to <span

<p>A product simpler than <a href="http://about.me" target="_blank">About.me</a>
</p>
<p>When two people exchange personal contact information, more should happen at that
  instance on your mobile phones and its web interface, with lesser taps, touches and
  clicks, automatically and simply.</p>
<p>That thought in our minds have triggered a whole gamut of research and solution
  design for this idea.</p>
<p>We are looking for 1 person with prior experience of having built mobile apps and is
  keen on assisting us on whatever we need him to assist us on. For now all we can
  offer this person is a chance to be a part of the team that is building this app</p>

<hr>
<p>
  The simplest, yet the most detailed contact information of people in your mobile.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  If I exchange a number, an email or a twitter handle with a person, he should get an
  access to all my public identity systems; but that doesn't happen yet. Instead there
  are longer and uglier ways of finding people on our phone contact books and even
  more complicated ways of finding them on social web
  <br>
  Add to contact cards through a pin, number, email or twitter, or any other product
  listed there. <br>
  -Cards with carousal exerience. <br>
  -Cards that can be flipped to follow latest feeds of this individual on the backside
  of the card. <br>
  -The experience of the whole product is this card. There is nothing more than 1 card
  that will meet the eye of the user at any given time. <br>
  We mean it, it is the simplest and more scalable solution to what bump and evernote
  hello attempted to do. <br>
  <br>
  What is indicated above is the phase 1 of this product.
  The next phase, i.e. phase 2, if done well may put us alongside the likes of
  whatsapp one day.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is enough relevance in this product to steer it towards a chat app of sorts
  for there will be context to chat right on the backside of the individual's card
  <br>
  To one day have this product be a 'protocol' for identity of millions of people on
  this <br>new age social web. <br>
  <br>
  We will together hustle enough to make this a reality. <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        If I exchange a number, an email or a twitter handle with a person, he should get an
        access to all my public identity systems; but that doesn't happen yet. Instead there
        are longer and uglier ways of finding people on our phone contact books and even
        more complicated ways of finding them on social web
        <br>
        Add to contact cards through a pin, number, email or twitter, or any other product
        listed there. <br>
        -Cards with carousal exerience. <br>
        -Cards that can be flipped to follow latest feeds of this individual on the backside
        of the card. <br>
        -The experience of the whole product is this card. There is nothing more than 1 card
        that will meet the eye of the user at any given time. <br>
        We mean it, it is the simplest and more scalable solution to what bump and evernote
        hello attempted to do. <br>
        <br>
        What is indicated above is the phase 1 of this product.
        The next phase, i.e. phase 2, if done well may put us alongside the likes of
        whatsapp one day.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is enough relevance in this product to steer it towards a chat app of sorts
        for there will be context to chat right on the backside of the individual's card
        <br>
        To one day have this product be a 'protocol' for identity of millions of people on
        this <br>new age social web. <br>
        <br>
        We will together hustle enough to make this a reality. <br>

                             <b>Nishchal Says,</b>
							 <br>
							I believe that in a contemporary society product leadership is enough. A mic and/or protests are not necessary.<br>
							 क्योंकि यह मैं मानता था कि आधुनिक जमाने की लीडर प्रोडक्ट्स से समाज में बदलाव ला सकते हैं। मैंने अपने 10 साल उसी प्रकार की लीडरशिप के माध्यम से एजुकेशन सिस्टम में चल रहे अन्याय को बदलने में लगा दिये है। आज उसका रिजल्ट यह है कि आप मेरी बनाई हुई चैटिंग एप और उसके संबंध मे लिखे हुये निबंध मे देख पाएंगे कि कैसे वार्तालाप और कर्मों के बीच भी ज्ञान दिया जा सकता है। एजुकेशन सिस्टम का अन्याय यह है कि उसने हर बच्चे किताब किताबी चार दिवारी में बंद कर दिया है। अब ना बच्चों के पास खुला वातावरण है और न ही फुर्सत, न ही गुरु है जिनसे प्रेरणा मिले| बच्चे अपनी आत्मा की कुर्बानी देकर ऐसे विद्यालय में दशियों साल समझौता कर रहे हैं मैं इस देश में यह सब बदलना चाहता था| यह बदलने के लिए मुझे लोकतंत्र के नेताओं और वोटों की शक्ति नहीं चाहिए थी, सिर्फ सॉफ्टवेयर इंजीनियर और मैनेजर की।
<br>
<b>The stars I am aiming for, just out of one tech product:</b><br>
1. To make all other todo listing, and note making apps redundant. (That will be a $1+ billion disruption)<br>
2. To then create, a social network of <b>action</b>. ($100+ billion disruption of current social network of talks).<br>
3. To then, create a culture of education upon communication and collaboration upon ones own ideas, using a field of artificial intelligence in the near future, NLP. ( $500 billion opportunity to create a new education landscape). Here education will happen just by chance.<br>
4. To then give preventive healthcare by measuring 5 elements in your body — earth, air, water, fire and ether.<br>
5. To then give you freedom from archaic education and healthcare systems.<br><br>

All through one app, this chat app, Chattodo. (To read more about it go to <a href="https://chattodo.preseed.in" target="_blank">chattodo.preseed.in</a>). 

<br><br>

<b>If the above comes true, we will have a business that works on its quest to understanding and recreating the science of the vedas. </b><br>

                Preseed Web Lab has been THE FOOD FOR NISHCHAL’S CURIOUS SOUL and like me, I
                hope one day, for many other curious ones. <br>
                Here we will aim to challenge the status quo, being the belief of people that
                you need money to lay the foundation for a great product. Lets see how far we
                reach with it. For now all I can say is that we are sitting on top of some very
                progressive ideas with very progressive people. <br>
                At Preseed Web Lab we are always looking for only 3 kinds of people — <br>
                1.Hackers <br>
                2.Hustlers <br>
                3.Designers <br>
                who are willing to build with us without any immediate compensation or
                contracts, from their bedrooms or dormitories or any other space they have. All
                they will get at this stage other than a solid product vision for a meaningful
                idea, is some words of commitment about their share of ownership in the product.
                It could be anything from a 10% to anything based on their role in driving that
                product forward. So if you can have faith, come on board. Write to us at
                do@preseed.in <br>
                What happens to the MVPs(Minimum Viable Products) that get built out of this
                process of brainstorming over ideas under the foundation of faith and
                inspiration not money? <br>
                Preseed Web Lab’s job was to get you to build MVPs around our ideas in good
                faith as partners. That itself sounds like a job well Done. <br>
                The following may happen when the MVPs get built, at this stage we move the
                project from Preseed Web Lab into Preseed Cooked Project-: <br>
                Together you and I hustle to have the product some beta users and real
                feedbacks. <br>
                Once we have the first set of users, it is established that the idea we
                discussed a few days ago is a customer validated unfinished product in a matter
                of days e.g. this app. That is the power of not only a solid product vision but
                the vision of it’s first iterations for achieving the MVP at no cost
                implications. <br>
                You and I get into a working partner relationship of sorts that has produced a
                product purely based on faith in each other, without wasting time in useless
                premature paper contracts or MOUs. No bullshit, only action. <br>
                Above all, the biggest hurdle before pitching an idea and team to a solid
                incubator anywhere in the world is, ‘ a customer validated product’.
                If now together we are able to clear the hurdle, we will bring us at a better
                place to take our product and the product teams to an incubator to steer the
                team and the concerned product forward. <br>
                In short -: We have created a possibility of creating web MVPs and teams that
                can be pitched to the best early stage internet startup incubators in the world.
                A typical web development company needs -: <br>
                1. People. <br>
                2. IT Infrastructure. <br>
                3. An office space to house those people. <br>
                4. Ideas/projects to consume these people in. <br>
                5. Enough money to sustain all of this. <br>
                Preseed Web Lab needs none of that and it still is capable of creating far
                bigger and better products than a typical web development company. That is the
                weight of inspiration, that is the weight of Preseed Web Lab. Here scores of
                developers and designers work not because we pay them handsome salaries, but
                because they are inspired to do so, regardless of what we pay them. By the way
                we pay them no salary, they are yet intrinsically motivated to build cool things
                with us. This human resource is our greatest strenght. <br><br>
                <span> <b>Status of Preseed Web Lab ideas as on 28/12/2013 </b> <br>
                  We measure our status based on how many incredibly talented hackers,
                  hustlers and
                  designers from India we have channeled into our ideas, without burdening
                  ourselves
                  with having to pay salaries. Our team page should help you decipher that. No
                  one on
                  that page is here to get salaries. <br>

                <strong>Only action over written words first. Just the way I have written in this essay plenty about
                  <br>I
                  and what am I here to do for you, I expect you to do the same.</strong><br><br>


                We don’t do physical meetings unless:<br></br>
                1. There is a signed detailed letter of intent by you indicating clearly all of what you seek from us.
                It
                can simply be an email to us from your highest relevant authority.<br></br>
                2. A written acknowledgment that you have gone through our essays on Medium, linked to our services
                listed
                on our home page www.preseed.in.<br></br>
                3. You have made efforts through communication with us on Whatsapp chats, voice notes, video calls,
                and
                emails to minimize ambiguity towards clarity of our relationship.<br></br>
                4. You have then proceeded to talk to us over phone calls.<br></br>
                5. You may come to the place of our being. Our office is in New Delhi and Lucknow. However, we mostly
                work
                from remote locations like the mountains or sometimes, the beaches. You may check with us about our
                current
                whereabouts, and come to meet us there instead.<br></br>

                If most of the above is done, and now there is a genuine need of a physical meeting at your place of
                being,
                after having used web technology for meetings and video conferencing, you may proceed to transfer the
                amount
                equal to the cost of a to and fro air ticket for us and a reasonable stay in your city, no less than
                Rs.
                25,000 in total in our bank account, per person visiting you, from our side:<br></br>

                For bank account info reach Nishchal's executive assistant at <br> <a
                  href="mailto:info@gencosys.com">info@gencosys.in</a>
                &nbsp; cc:<a href="mailto:admin@preseed.in">admin@preseed.in</a>

                <br></br>
                Once done, you may intimate us on our email with all of the above and we will proceed to book our
                tickets
                to
                you shortly.<br></br>

                There’s nothing more annoying than meeting just to meet. Business meetings aren’t effective when a
                decision
                needs to be made or for informational purposes. You can take care of that with a simple phone call or
                a
                company-wide email with a plea for no reply.<br></br>

                Unless it’s a brainstorming session, a meeting should be called only to support and convey a
                previously
                made
                decision. A productive business meeting produces a committed plan of action. To stay on track, curb
                any
                irrelevant discussions, interruptions, and repeated points.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Begin the meeting before it starts.</b><br><br>
                “Prepare people ahead of time so you are all on the same page when you enter the room,” Wrike founder
                Andrew
                Filev advises. “Create notes and an agenda in advance and — here’s the tricky part — actually review
                them
                before the meeting starts.”<br><br>

                He also recommends putting key information someplace where participants can see it and discuss it in a
                running thread well before the actual meeting. “That way, the meeting is focused on solving problems
                and
                not
                just describing them,” he says. “The first 10 minutes of your meeting shouldn’t be a discussion of why
                you’re meeting.”<br><br>

                This essay is just our attempt to ensure the meeting or series of meetings during our physical
                presence
                with
                you are fruitful.<br></br>

                <b>Note -:</b> We detest the idea of meetings when there are more than 5 participants and ambiguous
                reasons
                for the presence of 5. We don’t however mind numerous silent observers.
                <br><br>
                If you have any doubt about our understandings of efficient meetings, google “meetings are
                inefficient”
                or
                “meetings kill productivity” etc. Having said that, we don’t mean that this is always true. However,
                it
                is
                mostly always true when the agenda of the meeting is not clear with a defined boundary unless the
                agenda
                itself is — boundless brainstorming.
